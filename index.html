            <h2>A Short History</h2>
            <p>This church has a long and wonderful history, dating back to the early 1800s when circuit riders came through this part of the “wilderness” to preach, marry, bury, and baptize. A Methodist Church was established on this location in 1867 and remained in place until the congregation closed in 2023. That same year, a new group of people formed Open Doors as a New Faith Community. We are committed to meet people where they are and to offer as a place of hospitality where all are welcome!</p>
